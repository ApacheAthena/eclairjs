# AthenaJS

AthenaJS provides JavaScript and Node.js developers with an API for [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), and enables them to take advantage of Spark's unique data-processing environment that includes streaming, SQL, Machine Learning, and a graph database. Using AthenaJS, developers can write applications entirely in JavaScript, some of which will be executed in the local JavaScript environment such as Node.js, and some of which will be executed on Spark. AthenaJS is composed of a client component that runs in the local JavaScript environment, and can be simply installed from npm, and server components that can be remote from the client and handle JavaScript in Spark.

Note: AthenaJS is a renamed fork of the [EclairJS project](https://github.com/EclairJS/eclairjs) and this fork is currently very much "under construction".

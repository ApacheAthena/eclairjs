EclairJS
===================
**EclairJS** is a JavaScript client for Apache Spark.  It is a work-in-progress so it is a good idea to frequently check the [Guide to Using the JavaScript Spark API](https://github.com/EclairJS/eclairjs-node/wikis/Guide-to-using-the-JavaScript-Spark-API) for a list of what is currently implemented.

Overview
===================
**EclairJS** is made up of two components.  The **EclairJS Node** API and the **EclairJS Nashorn** API.

The **EclairJS Nashorn** API can be used completely on it's own, but it's intended purpose is to be used in conjunction with the **EclairJS Node** API.      

The [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/EclairJS/eclairjs-nashorn/wikis/Getting-Started-With-EclairJS-Nashorn#manual_build) for the **EclairJS Nashorn** API details when and how you may want to use **EclairJS Nashorn** on it's own.

**Please see the [EclairJS Node README](https://github.com/EclairJS/eclairjs-node) for more general information.**
